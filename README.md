# Cairngorm

The Cairngorm Microarchitecture is a lightweight yet prescriptive framework for Rich Internet application (RIA) development with Adobe Flex.

Cairngorm is an implementation of design patterns that the consultants at Adobe Consulting have successfully taken from enterprise software development (with technologies including J2EE and .NET) and applied rich Internet application development.
